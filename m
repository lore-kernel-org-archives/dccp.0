Right, I had the same reaction in reading this, but actually, his code
gets rid of the sockptr_advance stuff entirely and never mutates, so
even though my point about attacking those pointers was missed, the
code does the better thing now -- checking the base address and never
mutating the pointer. So I think we're good.

I was thinking the same, but just by making the pointers inside the
struct const. However, making the whole struct const via the typedef
is a much better idea. That'd probably require changing the signature
of init_user_sockptr a bit, which would be fine, but indeed I think
this would be a very positive change.
