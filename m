Yeah, we'll need to validate that before initializing the pointer.

But thinking this a little further:  doesn't this mean any
set_fs(KERNEL_DS) that has other user pointers than the one it is
intended for has the same issue?  Pretty much all of these are gone
in mainline now, but in older stable kernels there might be some
interesting cases, especially in the compat ioctl handlers.
